<h2>What Are Soft Skills?</h2>
<p>Soft skills are the more intangible and non-technical abilities that are sought from candidates. For example:</p>
<ul>
    <li> Communication</li>
    <li> Teamwork</li>
    <li> Problem-solving</li>
    <li> Leadership</li>
    <li> Responsibility</li>
</ul>
<p>Soft skills are sometimes referred to as transferable skills or professional skills. As this term implies, these are skills that are less specialised, less rooted in specific vocations and more aligned with the general disposition and personality of a candidate.</p>
<p>Soft skills relate to your attitudes and your intuitions. As soft skills are less about your qualifications and more personality-driven, it is important to consider what your soft skills are and how you might show evidence of them before you apply for a job.</p>

<h2>What Are the 5 Key Soft Skills?</h2>
<p>This section is an extensive, but not exhaustive, guide to some of the key soft skills sought by employers.</p>

<h3>1. Communication</h3>
<P>Communication is one of the most important soft skills. Able communicators can adjust their tone and style according to their audience, comprehend and act efficiently on instructions, and explain complex issues to colleagues and clients alike.

    A key, often forgotten, communication skill is listening. Whether you are dealing with a customer complaint or working with your colleagues, good listening skills will help you learn and respond correctly to the circumstance you have been presented with.
    
    Equally as important are your verbal and non-verbal skills. Verbal skills are key to fostering relationships that are collaborative and respectful, and, ultimately, productive. This also applies to your written communication.
    
    A lot of business communication is now played out by email, so it's important to know good email etiquette and give instructions clearly and concisely.</P>

<h3>2. Self-Motivation</h3>
<p>Having a positive attitude and the initiative to work well without around-the-clock supervision is a vital soft skill for any employee.

    Not only does it demonstrate reliability and commitment, but it also shows that you can fit efficiently into an organisational structure without the need for constant supervision.
    
    To demonstrate your motivation, think about these keys skills:</p>
  <ul> 
    <li>Positivity</li>
    <li>Ambition</li>
    <li>Commitment</li>
    <li>Initiative</li>
</ul> 

<h3>3. Leadership</h3>
<p>Leadership is a soft skill you can show even if youâ€™re not directly managing others. Those with strong leadership skills will have the ability to inspire others and lead teams to success. This is why it is a particularly sought-after skill.

    People with good leadership skills will have a range of skills that are useful in the workplace, including:
<ul>  
   <li>  A positive attitude and outlook</li>
   <li>  The ability to make quick and effective decisions</li>
   <li>  Exemplary problem-solving or conflict management skills</li>
   <li>  The ability to communicate effectively</li>
   <li>  An aptitude for both self-motivating and motivating others</li>
</ul>
 Even if you are applying for an entry-level role, don't be afraid to demonstrate your potential by showing how you have positively influenced others to take a project to success.</p>

<h3>4. Responsibility</h3>
<p>Responsibility is a seldom talked-about but highly valued soft skill. Colleagues who fail to take responsibility for their work will be less productive and less successful overall.

    To demonstrate a high level of responsibility, make sure you can master these skills:
<ul> 
   <li> Trustworthiness</li>
   <li>Discipline</li>
   <li>Motivation</li>
   <li>Conscientiousness</li>
   <li>Accountability</li>
</ul> 
    Taking responsibility means taking ownership of not only your goals but the wider company goals. This will mean taking the initiative to make improvements, accepting responsibility for any failures and really caring about working your way to success.</p>

<h3>5. Teamwork</h3>
<p>Like leadership, good teamwork involves a combination of other soft skills.

    Working in a team towards a common goal requires the intuition and interpersonal acumen to know when to be a leader and when to be a listener.
    
    Good team players are perceptive, as well as receptive to the needs and responsibilities of others.</p>
