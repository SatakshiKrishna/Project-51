<h1>Soft Skills</h1>
</div>
<p>Soft skills are a combination of people skills, social skills, communication skills, character or personality traits, attitudes, career attributes,social intelligence and emotional intelligence quotients, among others, that enable people to navigate their environment, work well with others, perform well, and achieve their goals with complementing hard skills.The Collins English Dictionary defines the term "soft skills" as "desirable qualities for certain forms of employment that do not depend on acquired knowledge: they include common sense, the ability to deal with people, and a positive flexible attitude."</p>
<p>Soft skills is a composite expression, and each of the two words explains a defining aspect of the concept.</p>
<p>The word “skill” highlights the practical function. The term alone has a broad meaning, and describes a particular ability to complete tasks ranging from easier ones like “learning how to kick a ball” to harder ones like “learning how to be creative." In this specific instance, the word “skill” has to be interpreted as the ability to master hardly controlled actions.</p>
<p>The word “soft” is the opposite of “hard”, may appear to mean “subjective, fuzzy, and unreliable," "but, "calling these skills soft or noncognitive belies their importance."Because of their subjectivity, soft skills are often not assessed and yet many in business consulting argue that they lie at the foundation of what makes a leader and will determine if an employee will rise to a leadership position. Soft skills represent personal skills necessary for such activities as team work and motivating others.</p>
